<div><h1>Page Title</h1></div>
<p>This the first paragraph of our page.It contains no useful information of whatever sort.
Just to test out some tags we're going to have a <strong>strong</strong> word. And to show that there is no visual difference
whatsoever between strong and bold we'll also have a <b>bold</b> word.</p>
<div><h2>Second Paragraph</h2></div>
<div><p>To begin our second paragrraph we'll make the rest of this text in pre-formatted mode
<pre>Inside the pre-formatted text we would like to <em>emphasize some words</em></pre>
    And then we would like to demonstrate the difference between <em>emphasized</em> and <i>italized</i> words,
    if there is such. <u>Underlining</u> in HTML is easy.</p></div>
<div><h3>Third Paragraph</h3></div>
<div><p>Now all that is left is to test the<sup>supscript</sup> and the <sub>subscript</sub>
as well as the line <br> brakes.
Note: This text is <br>written on a <br>single <br>line but <br>with line brakes.</p></div><br>
<div class="bold">You wanted more realism in Disney movies right?</div>
